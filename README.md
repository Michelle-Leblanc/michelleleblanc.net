## Introduction

I am a goal-oriented Web Development Director with a diverse skillset, making me a valuable asset across all digital channels within an organization. I possess a technical foundation in frontend development, UI/UX design, SEO, and email marketing, as well as leadership and communication skills. I thrive in fast-paced environments, particularly within smaller teams where I am comfortable wearing multiple hats. I have successfully led cross-functional teams of engineers throughout the entire software development lifecycle, from concept to launch.

Outside of work, I enjoy skiing and pickleball, but my favorite pastime is spoiling my retired greyhound.
